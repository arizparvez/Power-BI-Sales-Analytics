**Problem Statement:**

AtliQ Technologies required a comprehensive financial and sales data view to generate an accurate Profit and Loss (P&L) statement. The goal was to analyze key financial metrics such as net sales and gross margin, and to enable performance monitoring through profitability and growth matrices. This would support data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.



**A Step-by-Step Execution Plan:**

Step 1) Evaluate customers based on Net Sales, Gross Margin, and Gross Margin % to understand their overall contribution and profitability.
Step 2) Plot a scatter chart comparing Net Sales and Gross Margin, using Gross Margin % as a third dimension through bubble size or color intensity.
Step 3) Design a two-page scatter chart reportâ€”one focusing on market-level (country/region) performance and the other on customer-level details.
Step 4) Track performance trends across fiscal years 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 (including estimates), comparing both market and customer metrics year by year.
Step 5) Implement interactive dropdown slicers for country, region, and customer to enable dynamic filtering across the report.
Step 6) Construct a matrix with a tree-level hierarchy showing Segment, Category, and Product.


**Result:**

Enabled dynamic generation of Profit and Loss (P&L) statements for any customer, product, country, or a combination across customizable time periods. Delivered in-depth performance analysis using key metrics like Net Sales and Gross Margin, with interactive profitability and growth matrices. This empowered stakeholders with flexible, data-driven insights to evaluate financial health and optimize strategic decisions
